# Proposal - 2

## Project Title

Timetable app

## Project Background

A timetable application that interfaces with "relatively" accessible Scientia Ltd - 2.1.0 interface.
With minimal implementation this would improve the current cluster-muck that is timetable.ait.ie interaction and considering that Scientia is utilized by other colleges it could be adapted to also interact with those.
Develop in .dart using flutter. This I already have some work invested in.

## Project Challenge 

1. Interaction with existing timetable interface
2. Retrieving and displaying said infromation in a more presentable fashion
3. Notifications / saving / editing
4. Potential ability for organized edits (for adding afterschool activities, ect.)

## Proposal Approach

Intend to use flutter for its multi-platform desing. For exporting to Android, iOS, Web, Windows, Linux, MacOS.
Learning dart and using the flutter resources provided.
