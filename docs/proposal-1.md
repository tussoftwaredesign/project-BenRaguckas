# Proposal - 1

## Project Title

placeholder

## Project Background

Create a full stack application (Web / client app) utilising message broker (Redis / Kafka / RabbitMQ) to help distribute / outsource computation.
Approach it with package developement utilizing helm / minikube / dockerswarm for easier deployment and expansion.
This would mostly apply for developing the surbscribers to message brokers and the front end with hopefully minimal work related to message broker.

What are the challenges/bottlenecks/limitations of existing approaches? 
Not sure.

## Project Challenge 

1. Packaging and developement for containerisation
2. Developing working front end application
3. Outsorcing computation using message broker to packaged containers
4. Showcasing it all in action (ability to identify each step)

## Proposal Approach

Expand knowledge of containerisation drastically and learn how to package back-end to best utilize and scale the application with containers.
Develop the actual back-end capable of communicating well with fron-end. (most bare bones idea would be to create a visual display of multiple pathfinding algorythms)
