# Proposal - 3

## Project Title

Anchor Tower - a rogue lite tower defense game.

## Project Background

Develop a rogue lite TD (tower defense) game in godot or unity. Inspired by Binding of Isaac, Risk of Rain 2,...
Most favorable of godot for its lightweight aspect and ability to edit the engine itself using C++ to directly tackle potential peformance bottlenecks if needed. It is not as robust graphically and that is also desirable for the design (low-poly). 
Implement random noise-based-generation and Wavefunction collapse for map tile generation with greater inscentive of Wavefunction collapse for actual "terrain features" (eg: townscaper and bad north).
An AI or machine learning implementation for managing "effect interaction" (eg: synergies in binding of isaac).

## Project Challenge 

1. Learning about random noise-based-generation and Wavefunction collapse.
2. Game design: pacing / balance / Ux / Ui 
3. Ai and Machine learning
4. Sound and 3d design

## Proposal Approach

Need to expand and contrast project background for tihs.
